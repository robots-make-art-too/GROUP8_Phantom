			<h2>Excalibur: The Sword and the Stone</h2>
			<p id="demo">Have you ever heard of King Arthur? Being a popular source of Western legends and fairytales, the legends surrounding the British leader are well known. One of the most popular tales are about Excalibur, a legendary sword which had been magically embedded into a stone, with only King Arthur able to pull it out. <br>
				Our group was inspired by this legend and decided to focus our project on it. Enter our website, and find out whether the sword finds you, the user, worthy of the magical weapon. <br><br>
				Instructions:
				Enter the website, where youâ€™ll find a link to a QR code. This will lead you to open your camera, and you will see the sculpture with the sword and the stone. Test your luck, and see whether you are worthy of wielding the almighty weapon! </p>
